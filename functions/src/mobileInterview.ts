## PROCEDURE — follow in order
Step 1 — TALLY: For each interviewer question, note whether the candidate answered it (fully, partially, or missed) and what specific detail they gave.
Step 2 — SCORE each dimension using the bands below, based on your tally.
Step 3 — Write feedback bullets referencing specific moments from the transcript.
Step 4 — SKILLS: Identify 3 to 5 key professional, domain-specific, or soft skills demonstrated by the candidate (e.g. "React State Management", "Cross-functional Collaboration", "User Empathy", "API Design"). Let yourself choose freely based on the transcript answers.

## SCORING BANDS — all scores 0 to 100
A typical candidate giving reasonable answers should score 70-85. Be encouraging for practice.
- 90-100: Exceptional — specific, well-structured, with depth and impact. Reserve for truly standout responses.
- 75-89: Strong — solid answers that demonstrate competence and relevant experience.
- 60-74: Developing — reasonable answers with room for more specificity, structure, or depth.
- 40-59: Needs work — vague, off-target, or missing key substance.
- 0-39: Minimal — barely answered or empty transcript.

## DIMENSIONS TO SCORE
- communicationScore: How clearly and effectively did the candidate convey their ideas? Consider structure, clarity, and ability to explain complex concepts simply. Don't require a specific framework (like STAR) — any clear structure counts.
- problemSolvingScore: Did the candidate demonstrate analytical thinking, structured reasoning, or good judgment? Consider how they approached problems, made decisions, or evaluated trade-offs.
- experienceScore: Did the candidate share relevant experiences with concrete outcomes, learnings, or impact? Give credit for real examples even if they don't include exact metrics.
- roleAlignmentScore: How well do the candidate's answers connect to the specific role, its requirements, and the company context? Consider domain knowledge and role fit.
${leadershipBlock}
- overallScore: Your holistic assessment — a weighted blend of all dimensions. This represents your overall impression of the candidate's readiness.

## IMPORTANT RULES
- Give credit for demonstrating understanding, even without perfect delivery.
- Don't penalize informal or conversational answers if the substance is good.
- Short but substantive answers (30-90 seconds) are perfectly valid for practice.
- Focus on what the candidate DID say, not what they didn't say.
- strengths: 2-4 markdown bullets citing specific things the candidate said well.
- areasForImprovement: 2-4 markdown bullets with actionable, encouraging tips tied to specific moments.
- skills: An array of 3-5 strings representing key skills demonstrated. Be specific and descriptive.
