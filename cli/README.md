## Commands

### `cv interview`

**AI-powered voice mock interview** using the Gemini Live API. Vivid, your AI interviewer, conducts a real-time spoken interview tailored to the role you specify. After the session, you receive an auto-generated feedback report with scores and actionable improvement tips.

```bash
cv interview                               # interactive role prompt, voice mode
cv interview --role "Senior Software Engineer"
cv interview --role "Product Manager" --text   # text-only fallback (no mic needed)
cv interview --role "SDE" --resume <id>        # load your resume for context
cv interview --questions 7                     # custom question count (default 5)
```

**Requirements (voice mode):**
- `sox` for audio I/O — install once:
  ```bash
  # macOS
  brew install sox
  # Ubuntu / Debian
  sudo apt install sox
  ```

**How it works:**

1. Vivid generates tailored interview questions using your role (and resume, if provided)
2. A real-time voice session opens — speak your answers naturally
3. Vivid asks follow-up questions and adapts to your responses
4. Press **Ctrl+C** at any time to end
5. A structured feedback report is generated covering:
   - Overall, communication, confidence, and relevance scores (0–100)
   - Specific strengths and areas for improvement

**Interview History & Coaching:**

Every session (transcript + report) is automatically persisted to your CareerVivid account. This enables the **AI Agent** to provide post-interview coaching:

1. Complete an interview via `cv interview`.
2. Start the agent: `cv agent`.
3. Ask: *"How can I improve my answers from my last interview?"*
4. The agent retrieves your actual transcript and suggests **STAR-method** improvements for your specific responses.

**Credit cost:** **2 credits/minute** (minimum 2, maximum 60 per session)

| Session length | Credits |
|---|---|
| < 1 min | 2 |
| 5 min | 10 |
| 10 min | 20 |
| 30 min+ | 60 (cap) |

> Credits are only charged after the session ends — never upfront.

### `cv agent`

An **autonomous AI agent** that runs interactively in your terminal. Choose from CareerVivid Cloud (credits deducted from your account) or Bring Your Own API Key.

```bash
cv agent                  # General-purpose agent (Gemini Flash Lite)
cv agent --resume         # Resume CRUD mode: read, update fields, tailor
cv agent --jobs           # Job-hunting mode: search, apply, track pipeline
cv agent --coding         # Full coding toolkit: file I/O, shell execution, search
cv agent --pro            # Gemini Pro with extended thinking
```

**Options:**

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--resume` | Resume CRUD tools — read, set fields, tailor for a job, delete |
| `--jobs` | Job hunting + autonomous apply tools |
| `--coding` | Enable full coding tool suite (file read/write, shell, search) |
| `--pro` | Use `gemini-3.1-pro-preview` with thinking mode |
| `--think <budget>` | Enable thinking mode with a specific token budget (e.g. `8192`) |
| `--verbose` | Show thinking tokens in output |
| `--provider <name>` | Override provider: `careervivid` \| `openai` \| `anthropic` \| `openrouter` \| `gemini` \| `custom` |
| `--model <model>` | Override model (e.g. `gpt-4o`, `claude-opus-4-5`) |
| `--api-key <key>` | BYO API key for this session (not saved) |
| `--base-url <url>` | Custom OpenAI-compatible base URL |

**Configure your default provider:**

```bash
cv agent config
# → Interactive wizard: pick provider, model, API key
```

---

### `cv agent --jobs`

The most powerful mode. A conversational agent that thinks like a senior recruiter, manages your pipeline, and can **autonomously fill out job applications** using [browser-use](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use).

```bash
cv agent --jobs
```

**What it can do in a conversation:**

| You say... | Agent action |
|---|---|
| `"Find me ML engineering jobs"` | `search_jobs` → scores results vs. resume → `verify_search_results` to confirm all URLs work |
| `"Apply to this job: <URL>"` | `apply_to_job` → launches browser → fills form → stops before Submit for your review |
| `"What's in my pipeline?"` | `list_local_jobs` → shows Kanban board |
| `"What should I work on next?"` | `score_pipeline` → priority-ranked by attention × excitement × fit |
| `"I got an interview at Stripe"` | `update_local_job` → sets status to Interviewing, suggests follow-up |
| `"What am I neglecting?"` | `flag_stale_jobs` → surfaces cold applications |
| `"Show me my analytics"` | `get_pipeline_metrics` → apply rate, avg score, salary data |

**Autonomous Apply Harness** (`apply_to_job` tool):

The agent uses a multi-stage harness to fill job applications:

1. **URL Verification** — Every job link is verified live before the agent acts. Broken, hallucinated, or redirect-to-homepage URLs are rejected automatically.
2. **ATS Detection** — Automatically detects Ashby, Greenhouse, Lever, Workday, iCIMS, and more.
3. **TypeScript Adapter** — Fast-fills known fields (firstName, email, phone, LinkedIn, GitHub) using pre-loaded profile data.
4. **browser-use AI handoff** — For complex fields (cover letter, work auth, custom questions), the browser-use agent takes over with a rich task prompt built from your resume.
5. **Manual review gate** — The browser stays open. The agent **never** clicks Submit — you review and submit yourself.

> **Requires browser-use setup** — see [browser-use Setup](#browser-use-setup-autonomous-apply).

**Pipeline tracking (local CSV):**

The jobs agent also manages a local `jobs.csv` pipeline (v2 schema) with 8 attention metrics:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `attention_score` (1–10) | How top-of-mind is this company? |
| `excitement` (1–10) | Pure enthusiasm for the role |
| `apply_effort` | Low / Medium / High |
| `prep_time_hours` | Estimated research hours |
| `company_stage` | Seed / Series A-C / Public / Enterprise |
| `open_roles_count` | How many roles are currently open |
| `interview_rounds` | Known number of interview rounds |
| `last_activity_date` | Auto-stamped on every update |

**Priority Score = 40% attention + 30% excitement + 20% fit + 10% recency**

---

## browser-use Setup (Autonomous Apply)

The `apply_to_job` tool in `cv agent --jobs` and `cv jobs apply` use [browser-use](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use) — a Python AI browser automation library — to fill job applications.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+ with pip
- A virtual environment (recommended)

### Setup (one-time)

```bash
# 1. Create a Python virtual environment
mkdir -p ~/careervivid/browser-use
cd ~/careervivid/browser-use
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# 2. Install browser-use
pip install browser-use

# 3. Install Playwright browsers
playwright install chromium

# 4. Verify
python -c "import browser_use; print('browser-use ready')"
```

### How it works

When you run `cv agent --jobs` and ask to apply to a job:

1. The agent calls `apply_to_job` with the job URL
2. The CLI spawns `src/apply/browser_sidecar.py` (bundled with the npm package)
3. The sidecar launches a real Chrome browser (non-headless) using your profile
4. An AI agent fills the form field-by-field using your resume data
5. The browser **stays open** — you review every field and submit manually

> The agent will **never** click the final Submit button. You remain in full control.

### Resume PDF

Place your resume at `~/.careervivid/resume.pdf` and the sidecar will upload it automatically to resume upload fields.

```bash
cp ~/Downloads/MyResume.pdf ~/.careervivid/resume.pdf
```

---

## Whiteboard Templates

Run `cv list-templates` to see all available templates:

| Template | Description |
|---|---|
| `flowchart` | Generic flowchart / process diagram |
| `system-arch` | System architecture (client → API → DB) |
| `tech-stack` | Full technology stack diagram |
| `user-journey` | Sequence diagram (user ↔ API ↔ DB) |
| `er-diagram` | Entity-relationship / database schema |
| `git-flow` | Git branching and release flow |
| `ci-cd` | CI/CD pipeline (lint → test → build → deploy) |
| `mindmap` | Mind map / concept breakdown |

---

## AI Agent Integration (MCP / CI)

Use `--json` for structured output in automated pipelines.

```bash
# Pipe AI-generated markdown directly
echo "# My Architecture\n\nExplains the new service..." \
  | cv publish - --title "New Service Explained" --tags "architecture" --json

# Output:
# [{ "postId": "abc123", "url": "https://careervivid.app/community/post/abc123" }]
```

**System prompt for Cursor / Claude / Gemini:**

```
You have access to the `cv` CLI tool.

Available commands:
- cv interview                        AI voice interview (requires sox)
- cv publish <file>                   Publish an article (private by default, use --public to share)
- cv agent --resume                   Resume CRUD: read, update fields, tailor
- cv agent --jobs                     Job hunting + autonomous apply
- cv jobs hunt --role "..."           AI job search
- cv jobs apply <url>                 Autonomous form filling (stops before submit)
- cv jobs list                        View job tracker

Rules:
1. Never include real API keys in published content.
2. Always use --json for machine-readable output.
3. Articles are PRIVATE by default. Only use --public if user explicitly requests it.
```

## Updating

```bash
npm install -g careervivid
cv -v
```

---

## Troubleshooting

**`cv: command not found`**
```bash
npm config get prefix
# Add <prefix>/bin to your PATH in ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc
```

**`Unauthorized` error**
```bash
cv auth check
CV_API_KEY=cv_live_YOUR_KEY cv publish article.md
```

**`cv interview` — no audio / can't hear Vivid**
```bash
# Install sox first:
brew install sox          # macOS
sudo apt install sox      # Ubuntu/Debian

# Then retry:
cv interview
```

**`cv interview` — hearing echo / Vivid repeating itself**

This can occur if your microphone picks up the speaker output. The CLI uses half-duplex mute suppression (mic is muted while Vivid is speaking). Use headphones for the best experience.

**`browser_sidecar.py not found`**
```bash
# browser-use is not set up. Follow the browser-use Setup section above.
# Verify your venv path:
ls ~/careervivid/browser-use/.venv/bin/python
```

**`aiohttp is not defined` or `ainvoke() takes 2 positional arguments`**
```bash
# Update to the latest version (fixed in v1.12.5+)
npm install -g careervivid@latest
```

**`❌ No API key found` when using CareerVivid Cloud**
```bash
cv auth check          # verify your CV API key is set
cv agent config        # reconfigure your LLM provider
```

**`cannot add command 'agent'` error (< v1.12.2)**
```bash
npm install -g careervivid@latest
```

**Job URL is broken / agent says it can't confirm the link**
The agent uses a live URL verification harness. If a link fails verification it will tell you instead of sending you to a broken page. Search for the role directly on the company's careers page or LinkedIn.

**Article shows as public even though I said private**
Update to v1.12.6+ — articles are now private by default. Use `--public` or tell the agent `"publish publicly"` to share with the community.

**Permission denied on `~/.careervividrc.json`**
```bash
chmod 600 ~/.careervividrc.json
```
