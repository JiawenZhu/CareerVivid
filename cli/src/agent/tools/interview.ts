    description: `Launch a live AI mock interview session for the user.

Use this tool when the user says ANYTHING like:
- "Start an interview", "practice interview", "mock interview"
- "Interview me for [role]", "prep me for [company] interview"
- "I have an interview at [company], let's practice"
- "Start a voice interview", "text interview"

⚠️  MANDATORY PRE-FLIGHT — before calling this tool, you MUST know:
1. **role** — which job role to interview for (ask if not mentioned)
2. **mode** — ALWAYS ask the user: "Voice (real-time speech, requires sox) or Text?"
   Never assume voice. Some users are on servers, don't have a mic, or prefer text.
   Only skip asking if the user already said 'voice' or 'text' in their message.
3. **questions** — optional, default 5 (no need to ask unless user wants to customize)

Example pre-flight:
  User: "Can I take an interview?"
  You:  "Sure! What role are you interviewing for, and would you prefer Voice or Text mode?"
  User: "Senior SWE, voice please."
  You:  → call start_interview(role="Senior Software Engineer", mode="voice")

HOW IT WORKS:
- Launches the full interactive \`cv interview\` session directly in the terminal.
- The user speaks (voice mode) or types (text mode) their answers to Vivid, the AI interviewer.
- At the end, a feedback report with scores and improvement tips is displayed automatically.
- You (the agent) can then discuss results, coach on weak areas, help build STAR stories, etc.

CREDIT COST: 2 credits/minute (minimum 2, capped at 60). Text mode uses ~1 credit flat.

DEFAULTS:
- mode defaults to "voice" (requires sox). Suggest "text" if user is on a server / no mic.
- questions defaults to 5.`,
